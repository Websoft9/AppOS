# AppOS Backend

PocketBase-based application server with custom business logic compiled into a single Go binary.

## Architecture

- **PocketBase** as application framework (auth, DB, realtime, admin UI)
- **Custom routes** for Docker operations, proxy management, terminal, backup
- **Asynq + Redis** for persistent async task processing (embedded worker)

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+
- Redis (for Asynq task queue)
- Docker (host access via socket)

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run with hot-reload (requires air: go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest)
air

# Or run directly
go run cmd/appos/main.go serve --dev

# Build
go build -o appos cmd/appos/main.go

# Run production binary
./appos serve --http=0.0.0.0:8090
```

## OpenAPI Maintenance

OpenAPI docs are embedded into the `appos` binary and served at:

- `/openapi` (Swagger UI)
- `/openapi/spec` (raw YAML)

Primary spec file:

- `backend/docs/openapi/api.yaml` (generated merged artifact)

Recommended workflow after route changes:

```bash
# from project root
make openapi-sync
```

Available commands:

- `make openapi-gen` — regenerate `ext-api.yaml` from `/api/ext/*` route source (machine-generated)
- `make openapi-merge` — merge `ext-api.yaml` + `native-api.yaml` into `api.yaml`
- `make openapi-check` — fail when Ext route/spec drift or duplicate YAML keys exist
- `make openapi-sync` — run generate + merge + check in order

Maintenance rules:

- Keep `native-api.yaml` manually curated.
- Treat `ext-api.yaml` as generated file (do not edit manually).
- Treat `api.yaml` as generated merge artifact (do not edit manually).
- Rebuild backend (`make build backend`) after spec updates so embedded docs are refreshed.
